Implementation of Non-Transferable Tokens in Ethereum

The NFT space is flourishing within the crypto ecosystem. In 2021 alone, there was a whopping $17.7 Billion in NFT trades volume. However, the application of NFTs is limited to ownership verification of a digital, or a real-world commodity. An NFT, by design, is transferable and deters its use of it in a wider area of application. This project is a work to implement a new standard of tokens in a blockchain ecosystem that can be used for multiple purposes, including, but not limited to, Identification, Certification, Ticketing, and Voting.
